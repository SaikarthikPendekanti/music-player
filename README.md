This project is a Basic Web-Based Music Player designed to provide users with a simple and interactive way to play audio tracks in a web browser.
Its a great way to learn and practice fundamental web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring multimedia handling in a web environment.

Technologies Used:-
1) HTML: Used to structure the content of the music player, including the audio element, buttons, and playlist.
2) CSS: Used to style the music player, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
3) JavaScript: Used to add interactivity and functionality to the music player, such as handling play/pause, skip, and volume control.
